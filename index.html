        <p>My dearest Klara,</p>
        <p>I want to begin by telling you how deeply sorry I am for the moments when I wasn’t my best for you. I never meant to make you feel hurt or unappreciated, and I regret every second of it. But above all, I want you to know this: My love for you is infinite, and every day with you is a blessing. Even when we’re far apart, my heart beats only for you. You are my everything.</p>
        <p>We may have our ups and downs, but I promise you this—no matter what happens, I will always choose you. You are the love of my life, and I will spend every moment showing you just how much you mean to me. I vow to love you, to care for you, to stand by you, and to grow with you, for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p>I am here for you, through thick and thin, and I will always cherish you. Together, we will create a future full of love, joy, and beautiful memories. I love you more than words can say, and I always will. Forever yours, Junseong 💖</p>
